Parameter Selection




Steering angle:

Based on testing, I kept the following values.

Proportional Constant (Kp) - Kept it at 0.15 as it gave near equal amplitude assuming vehicle is driven on straight road.

Differential Constant (Kd) - Kept it at 2.5 to achieve dampening for overshoot due to proportional factor.

Integral Constant (Ki) - Kept it at 0.001 to avoid oscillations.




Steering angle and throttle:

After trial and error, I selected 10 for the Kd of the throttle pid controller. The throttle should be decreased if cross
track error (cte) is high. Therefore, the hyper parameters for throttle is decreased or increased only when the rate of
change of cte cross track error (cte) is high.

Therefore, only Kd for throttle is being tuned.

With throttle controller set, I again tuned the parameters for steering controller similar to steps above
and finally set the :

"Kp", "Kd" and "Ki" to 0.3, 2.7 and 0.001 respectively.
